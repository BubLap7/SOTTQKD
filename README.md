# [SOTT Quick Krunker Docs](https://krdocs.swatdo.ge/)

https://krdocs.swatdo.ge/

A Krunker documentation website that purely focusses on KrunkScript (no editor/monitization).

- Unmerging/Merging docs so you can use CTRL + F, like the old documentation.
- More up to date.
- Removes flaws from the original documentation.
- Important notes for developers, that quickly show important .information, like rate limits or deprecation.
- Clearer & less text, removed bloaty examples.
- Cosistent formatting across the website.
- Prefilled action parameters, allowing you to instantly paste and test code.
- Quick access to frequently used stuff, like the entire player object or a list of all hooks.
- [An extension to directly integrate the documentation into the editor.](https://github.com/SwatDoge/SOTT-Quick-Krunkscript-Docs/raw/main/tampermonkey/userscript.user.js)
