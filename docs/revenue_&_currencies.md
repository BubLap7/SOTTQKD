## How to make Money

Krunker offers several ways for game developers to earn money from their creations.\
In order to qualify for payouts you must be an approved [Krunker Partner](./files/revenue?id=krunker-partner).

## Gameplays

Every time someone plays your game, you get paid.\
This revenue share is calculated based on ad impressions on your game:

**revenue (USD) = ((gameplays / 1000) \* 0.08)**

## Video Ads

Using KrunkScript you can choose to display a video-ad on the players screen. Here are some use-cases where it makes sense to display a video-ad:

 * **Reward for watching:** Coins, Items, Stage Skip etc.
 * **Between game rounds:** Play an ad when the round ends.
 * **On death:** When a player dies, you can play an ad if enough time has passed since the last ad.

It is important that you make the ads as non-intrusive as possible. If uses are complaining about the presence of ads, you are doing it wrong.

**Example Script:**

<p class="hidep"><strong class="client-side">client-side</strong></p>

```krunkscript
# play fullscreen video ad
GAME.ADS.playVideo(); # can only be called every 5 mins
```

## Referral Link

A referral link allows us to track how a new player comes to Krunker.\
When a player signs up with your referral link, you get paid every time they play any Krunker game.\
To fully take advantage of this system, make sure to include your referral code when sharing your games URL: [https://krunker.io/?play=AIM_Room&ref=CODEHERE](https://krunker.io/?play=AIM_Room&ref=CODEHERE)
