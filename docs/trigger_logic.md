## Triggers Introduction

Triggers offer a non-scripting solution to creating your own game logic. Triggers interact with eachother using interface IDs. Think of it like walkie talkies that communicate on a certain frequency.

## Trigger Events

Events will allow you to listen for game events and trigger specific actions accordingly:

| **1** | **onMelee** | When you knife/melee your trigger object, the trigger action will execute. |
| **2** | **onDamage** | If you do damage to the trigger object in any way(shooting, knifing etc), the trigger action will execute. |
| **3** | **onEnterObject** | As soon as you enter the trigger object, the trigger action for it will execute. |
| **4** | **onDestroy** | As soon as the object gets destroyed, the trigger action will execute. You can set a health to your object so you know how much damage people will need to do to your object to destroy it. |
| **5** | **onRespawn** | Once the object respawns, the trigger action will execute. You can set a respawn timer for each object to control how fast it respawns and more. |

## Triggers & Scripts

Triggers and [Scripts](./files/scripting?id=introduction) can interact with eachother. 
For example you can call a KrunkScript action from a Trigger Event.
___

Using Triggers to execute custom script action:

```krunkscript
Custom Action 58):(
    playerID, # player id passed in automatically
    customParam, # custom string you can pass in
    value # custom number you can pass in
)
```

When this action executes, it will automatically call the onCustomTrigger hook action in the server script:

In order to call a custom action from a Trigger Object, make sure you declare it as a public action:

<p class="hidep"><strong class="server-side">server-side</strong></p>

```krunkscript
public action onCustomTrigger(str playerID, str customParam, num value) {
    # do something
}
```

___

<div class="disBar">Currently Disabled</div>

**Using KrunkScript** to exectute a Trigger Action:

```krunkscript
GAME.TRIGGERS.execute(
    ID, # num action ID,
    args # other arguments depends on action
);
```
